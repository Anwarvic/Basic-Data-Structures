⏱ Time-Complexity
-------------------
The following table sums up all the different public functionality in this
class and also provides the worst-case time complexity along side with the
optimal time complexity that I will try to reach in future releases Insha'Allah.
Generally, we are going to use the following indicators in the table:

- **n** is the number of elements currently in the linked list.
- **m** is the number of elements in the *other* linked list.
- **k** is the value of a given index.
